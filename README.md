# Variable-selection-in-metabolomics #

Objective: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with bootstrapping applied for variable selection in the non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data

Conclusions: The LASSO offers potential improvements over standard linear regression due to the presence of the constrain, which promotes sparse solutions.

This paper is the first one to date utilizing the LASSO penalized logistic regression in untargeted metabolomics studies.
